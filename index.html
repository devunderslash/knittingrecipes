                        <p>Knit every row until work measures <span id="leglength"></span> inches, or until desired length.</p>
                        <h3>Heel</h3>
                        <div class="hide" id="flapInstructions">
                            <h4>Heel Flap</h4>
                            <p>This flap uses a slip-stitch heel stitch.  Feel free to substitute any stitch pattern, as long as the length ends up the same.  One suggestion is the <a href="http://www.haveayarn.ca/stitch/03_2009_stitch_of_the_month.htm" target="_blank">eye of partridge heel stitch</a>.</p>
                            <p>The flap is worked flat over the next <span class="heelsts"></span> sts.</p>
                            <p>Row 1 (RS): *k1, sl1 wyib; rep from * to end<br />
                            Row 2 (WS): p to last stich, sl1 wyif
                            </p>
                            <p>Rep rows 1 and 2 <span id="heel-flap-repeats"></span> more times, or until flap is length desired, ending after a RS row.</p>

                            <h4>Heel Turn</h4>
                            <p>Row 1 (WS): p<span id="heelturnp"></span>, p2tog, p1, turn<br />
                            Row 2 (RS): sl1 wyib, k5, ssk, k1, turn<br />
                            Row 3 (WS): sl1 wyif, p to one st before gap, p2tog, p1, turn<br />
                            Row 4 (RS): sl1 wyib, k to one st before gap, ssk, k1, turn</p>
                            <p>Rep rows 3 and 4 until all gaps have been closed and all heel sts have been worked, ending with a RS row.  The last repeats of rows 3 and 4 will not include the final p1 and k1, respectively.</p>

                            <h4>Return to working in the rnd</h4>
                            <p>Your heel turn has just ended on a RS row. Continue working this RS row in the following manner:
                            <p>
                                Pick up and knit each edge st along first side of the heel flap<br />
                                Place marker<br />
                                Knit across the instep (i.e. the sts you have not been working for the heel)<br />
                                Place marker<br />
                                Pick up and knit each edge st along the other side of the heel flap<br />
                                Knit all heel sts, placing a marker halfway through the heel to mark BOR, if desired
                            </p>
                            <p>You have now returned all sts to your needles and are ready to continue working in the rnd.</p>
                            <h4>Gusset</h4>
                            <p>Row 1: k to 3 sts before marker, k2tog, k1, k across instep (to marker), k1, ssk, k to BOR<br />
                            Row 2: k around</p> 
                            <p>Rep rows 1 and 2 until the st count has returned to <span class="caston"></span>.</p>
                            <p>Be sure to stay aware of which half of the sts is your instep and which half is your sole. You will need this information for the toe.</p>

                            <p>Rep rows 2 and 3 until all wraps have been picked up, ending with a RS row.  You are now ready to continue in the rnd to work the rest of the sock.</p>

                            <h3>Foot</h3>

                            <p>Knit to the beginning of the instep sts, then begin the toe decreases as follows:</p>

                                Row 2: k around</p>
                            <p>Rep rows 1 and 2 until you have <span id="toests"></span> sts remaining.  Then, rep row 1 twice more.</p>
                            <p>At the end of your decreases, you should have <span class="finaltoests"></span> sts remaining, <span class="half-finaltoests"></span> on the instep and <span class="half-finaltoests"></span> on the sole.</p>
                            <p>Cut the yarn, leaving a tail long enough to graft the toe.  Use the <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEsummer04/FEATtheresasum04.html" target="_blank">Kitchener stitch</a> to graft the toe closed.</p>
